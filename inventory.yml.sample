      # A minimum of three master nodes are required. More are supported.
      # Worker nodes are not required, but if present there must be two or more.
      #
      # Node Required Vars:
      # - role
      #     - Must be either "master" or "worker", and must match the group
      #
      # - mac
      #     - The MAC address of the node, used as a hardware identifier by Assisted Installer.
      #     - The value set here will be used when creating VMs and must be unique within the network.
      #
      # - vendor
      #     - One of "Dell", "HPE", "Lenovo", "SuperMicro", "KVM", "PXE" as the supported BMC APIs.
      #     - "KVM" identifies a node as a VM to be created. If a "KVM" node is present,
      #       then a "vm_host" must be defined in the node and a host with that name must exist
      #       inside the "vm_hosts" group.
      #     - "PXE" identifies a node as a baremetal that needs to boot from PXE.
      #
      # - bmc_address
      # - bmc_user
      # - bmc_password
      #     - details for the BMC that controls the node.
      #     - Must be set to the vm_host for "KVM" nodes.
      #
      # Static IP Vars:
      #   See docs/inventory.md: Network configuration section
      #
      # Optional Vars:
      # - vm_spec

      #          - cpu_cores
      #          - ram_mib
      #          - disk_size_gb
      #
      # - installation_disk_path
      #     - The value set here will be used by Assisted Installer as the installation disk device
      #       for a given host.
      #     - The value must be a path to the disk device, e.g. /dev/sda
      #     - If not specified, Assisted Installer will pick the first enumerated disk device for a
      #       given host.
